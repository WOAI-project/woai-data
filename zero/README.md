# NFT data for WOAI/Zero

This repository contains all data related to the WOAI/Zero -collection NFTs.

Each json file matches with the ID of the NFT in question. I.e.: WOAI/Zero/1 maps to 1.json

The contents of this folder are to be hosted at woai.io/nft-data/zero/

Once all NFTs have been minted, or at least most of them, the contents of this folder will be uploaded onto an IPFS instance. Following this change, the baseURI of the WOAI/Zero smart contract will be changed to reflect the right IPFS location. Until then, the baseURI will be https://woai.io/nft-data/zero/
